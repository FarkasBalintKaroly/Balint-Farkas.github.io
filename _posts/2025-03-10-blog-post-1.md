## Overview

In this project, I successfully integrated a UR5e collaborative robot arm into NVIDIA Isaac Sim and controlled it using ROS2 and MoveIt2. The primary objective was to validate the MoveIt2 motion planning pipeline in a realistic simulation environment using a robot model similar to the one available in the lab.

The simulation setup included full motion planning, kinematic control, and gripper integration - all visualized in RViz2.

## Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Ubuntu 22.04**
- **ROS2 Humble**
- **RViz2**
- **Isaac Sim 4.5**
- **Universal Robots UR5e URDF**
- **Robotiq 2F-85 gripper URDF**

## Implementation Steps

1. **MoveIt2 Configuration Generation:**
   - Used the MoveIt2 Setup Assistant to generate configuration files for the UR5e and Robotiq 2F-85 gripper.
   - Defined the planning group, end-effector, and reference frames.

2. **Initial MoveIt2 Testing:**
   - Launched `demo.launch.py` to test the MoveIt2 configuration in RViz2.
   - Validated joint planning and motion visualization standalone, without simulation.

3. **Installation of Topic-Based ROS2 Control:**
   - Installed required topic-based ROS2 control system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install ros-humble-topic-based-ros2-control
     ```

4. **URDF/XACRO Modification:**
   - Integrated the `topic_based_ros2_control/TopicBasedSystem` plugin into the robot's xacro.
   - Defined `joint_commands_topic` and `joint_states_topic` parameters.

5. **ROS2 Bridge Configuration:**
   - Set up Isaac Simâ€™s ROS2 bridge to forward relevant joint topics between ROS2 and the simulator.

6. **UR5e Import into Isaac Sim:**
   - Imported the UR5e URDF as an Articulation Root in Isaac Sim.
   - Verified joint hierarchy and base link alignment.

7. **Action Graph Configuration in Isaac Sim:**
   - Created an Action Graph to:
     - Subscribe to the `joint_commands` topic and apply commands to the articulation.
     - Publish simulated joint states to the `joint_states` topic.

8. **Gripper Integration Fixes:**
   - For the Robotiq 2F-85 gripper, fixed non-driven joints to prevent simulation issues caused by closed kinematic chains.
   - Applied proper articulation constraints to maintain realistic behavior.

9. **System Validation:**
   - Confirmed end-to-end operation:
     - Real-time motion planning in MoveIt2.
     - Command execution in Isaac Sim.
     - Full bidirectional communication between Isaac Sim and ROS2 via ROS2 Bridge.
   - RViz2 visualization confirmed trajectory correctness and real-time feedback.

## Demo

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrated a real-time, ROS2-based motion planning setup using MoveIt2 with a simulated UR5e robot and gripper in Isaac Sim. This setup provides a strong foundation for later sim-to-real experiments.
