## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a simulated RGBD camera in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and visualize its data in RViz2 through ROS2. The goal was to establish a perception pipeline that mirrors real-world robotic perception setups, using the Isaac Sim ROS2 bridge to forward camera topics into the ROS2 ecosystem.

The result is a live visualization of RGB image streams and depth data from a simulated camera mounted in the environment, as typically used in object detection or manipulation tasks.

## Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Ubuntu 22.04**
- **ROS2 Humble**
- **RViz2**
- **Isaac Sim 4.5**

## Implementation Steps

1. **Simulated Camera Setup:**
   - Added a virtual camera to the Isaac Sim scene using parameters similar to the Intel RealSense D435.
   - Enabled both RGB and Depth output channels.

2. **Action Graph Configuration:**
   - Created an Action Graph in Isaac Sim to publish ROS2-compatible topics:
     - `/rgb/image_raw`
     - `/depth/image_raw`
     - `/camera_info`
   - Defined appropriate output pins and connected them to the ROS2 bridge nodes.

3. **Namespace and Frame Configuration:**
   - Ensured consistent frame naming (e.g., `camera_link`) and added the necessary TF broadcasters.
   - Verified static transforms and frame hierarchy compatibility with ROS2 TF expectations.

4. **RViz2 Setup:**
   - Added image and depth visualization panels in RViz2.
   - Subscribed to  `/rgb/image_raw` and `/depth/image_raw`, using `/camera_info` for calibration parameters.

5. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Verified that RGB and depth images streamed correctly and in sync.
   - Confirmed that camera pose and intrinisics matched expectations.

## Demo

*A video demonstration shows the RGB and depth streams from the Isaac Sim virtual camera being visualized live in RViz2, simulating a perception pipeline similar to real-world robotic setups.*

## Outcome

This project establishes a ROS2-compatible perception pipeline from Isaac Sim to RViz2 using a simulated RGBD camera. The setup serves as a foundation for future vision-based tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, or visual grasp planning.
