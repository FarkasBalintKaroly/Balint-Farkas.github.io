### Abstract

This paper aims to outline both hardware and
software design to create a reliable and efficient framework
for future robotics and reinforcement learning research. The
primary goal of this paper is to design and establish a functional
environment for a reinforcement learning pick-and-place project.
This includes the integration of key hardware components, as
well as the development of a robust software architecture. The
software setup will be built around ROS (Robot Operating
System) to provide seamless communication and control of the
system. Additionally, plans for software integration will include
the use of NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator for AI-driven motion
planning and object detection, leveraging tools like cuMotion and
FoundationPose. This environment will be a solid foundation to
future researches.
