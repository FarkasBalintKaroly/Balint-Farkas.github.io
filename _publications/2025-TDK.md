excerpt: 'This study explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to autonomous robotic manipulation using a UR5e robotic arm, a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper, and an Intel RealSense D435 camera in the NVIDIA Isaac Sim environment. Several state-of-the-art RL algorithms (PPO, TRPO, TD3, SAC) are trained and compared on a cube lifting task. The work also introduces a Sim2Real transfer framework to evaluate real-world deployment.'

This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based approach to autonomous robotic grasping and lifting with a UR5e robotic arm. The system is implemented and trained in the NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulation environment, utilizing a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and RealSense D435 depth camera. The observation and action spaces are designed to reflect realistic manipulation constraints, and a complex reward function guides the training process. The performance of multiple RL algorithms—including PPO, TRPO, TD3, and SAC—is evaluated and compared through experimental results. In addition, a Sim2Real pipeline is developed and demonstrated, facilitating the deployment of the trained policy on a real robot platform. The study highlights both the potential and the challenges of transferring learned policies from simulation to the real world.
